########## Quality Performance


post.php: issue title,description and content is sometimes blank after form submission. And can create errors to overall posts because somewhere in SQL array selection row is empty(null). (disrupts feed).

post.php: before uploading images verify them and its extension type. If post is not fully done then delete. re-design if possible and fit ajax where needed.

important bug: update all validation checking for any input/output users entered. 

important bug: use trim() on pgsql where needed. 

important bug: <line 490> uses proper_nouns.php dont split sentence '/' only words when space is found

important fix: continue to convert to AJAX for better quality and performance where users interact on the 				 platform.
